    "text": "W3: Smile for the Camera: Selfies\n\nJenka Gurfinkel, “AI and the American Smile” (Medium, 17 March 2023)\nMichael Standaert, “Smile for the Camera: The Dark Side of China’s Emotion-Recognition Tech” (The Guardian, 3 March 2021)\n\n\nIn flattening the diversity of facial expressions of civilizations around the world AI had collapsed the spectrum of history, culture, photography, and emotion concepts into a singular, monolithic perspective. It presented a false visual narrative about the universality of something that in the real world — where real humans have lived and created culture, expression, and meaning for hundreds of thousands of years — is anything but uniform.\n\n\n—Jenna Gurfinkel, “AI and the American Smile”\n\nSo this week we are tackling everybody’s favorite social-media topic: the selfie, or if you’ve read the reading assignment, might be more accurately called the smilie.\nI initially assigned only Jenna Gurfinkel’s article for this week, because the article itself is packed with references to other sources that you are presumably also going to want to explore. But as I was rereading it, I decided to add one other recent article that came to mind, that adds a different perspective to the discussion of social media, cameras, and smiling: a Guardian article about the use of facial recognition as a tool of social control in contemporary China. So in some ways, this week we could think about not just the smile but the face in social media, as a focus of social, cultural, and political power.\nConceptually, the trickiest concept that’s referenced in the AI-selfie article is “uncertainty avoidance,” a rather self-contradictory notion that may need clarification. My favorite example of this is from country walking. As I’m sure you know, it’s an unspoken convention when out walking in a forest or some other remote location, that if you pass someone walking in the other direction, you are expected to make eye contact, say “Hi!,” and above all, smile at the other person(s)! Why do we all do this? We don’t do it when walking around town, for example. The answer is: to avoid uncertainty - uncertainty, that is, about the potentially malevolent intentions of the other we are encountering in this remote place. In short, eye contact, a brief verbal greeting, and, especially, a smile are a way of reassuring the other person that you are not a psycho.\nOf course, given that as the article also explains (in the reference to the University of Rochester study), smiling is also a sign of duplicity, there is no reason to be reassured by the smiling stranger that we may encounter alone in a forest; in such cases, indeed, the smile may actually be more a source of anxiety than reassurance.\nRegardless of whether smiles and a cheerful demeanor are reassuring or not, the central point of the article is that smiling is a cultural practice: even though everyone smiles (universal humanism), we do so - or not - for very different reasons (cultural specificity). The Russian examples discussed in the article are perhaps the clearest example of this.\nThe central question raised by Gurfinkel’s argument, however, stems from its title: how far can smiling—at least self-type smiling—be considered specifically “American”? Did Americans invent this kind of smiling?\nIn answer to this, I would add one other example to the discussion of the cultural dimension of smiling: what I would call the subaltern smile. (“Subaltern” here refers to a form of social subjectivity that has internalized structures of domination and accept, even welcome, their position of subservience). From this standpoint, the smile is a sign of subservience, of eagerness to be of service - is there anything else I can do for you? As the example of the Russian bank teller in the US shows, such smiling is often not just a social but a professional requirement, a form of coercion. In his book Black Skin, White Masks, the postcolonial theorist Franz Fanon writes about how during imperialism Africans were expected to smile for their colonial masters, as a sign of their willing acceptance of their subservient role. There are numerous examples of this, but the most famous one is the ubiquitous image of the WW1/WW2 African infantryman in the French army (the tirailleur sénégalais) that was used for the chocolate milk brand Banania.\n\n\n\nWe see from this example that Gurfinkel’s point that smiling is a sign of confidence or power does not always apply, that smiling has many other cultural meanings.\nWhat if AIs were trained not on models of American smiles but African ones? In light of the history of slavery, how awkward does this make the AI selfie of “Ancient African Tribal Warriors”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfie Studies\nThe discussion of “smiling for the camera” is itself part of the larger study of the selfe in social media, a field that is much more developed than you would ever believe. To get an idea of the scope of this field, you could start with the Selfies Research Network, founded (as far as I know) by Theresa Senft and other colleagues, notably Alice Marwick. In light of this week’s reading, you may be struck by Alice’s authentically American smile!\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring selfie culture for your research paper, there are many directions you could go, including music video:\n\nI’ll be interested to see what other examples are brought to mind both by this week’s readings and my lecture!"

    "text": "W1: Interpassive Aggressive\nI hope that by now you’ve had chance to look at at least the first of the articles by Rob Horning, and hopefully also some of the sources that he links to - especially the New York Times articles about TikTok (hereafter TT).\nAs you know, he references Becky Hughes’s short piece about TT recipe videos, which is really good. I’ve also posted a page with links from the TT trends article on the syllabus outside Blackboard (see the dropdown menu under Resources).\nSo there are a few things I was thinking about in selecting this reading assignment for us to get started with:\n\nWhat does it mean exactly to “theorize” about “social media”?\nWhat exactly does the term “social media” cover anyway?\nHow do we even begin to “theorize” about a SM platform like TikTok and the many cultures proliferating on it?\n\nRob Horning’s critique at least gives us a place to start, and an example of engaging in critical analysis of (commonly known as “theorizing”) social media. I guess the first thing to note is that it is a critique - that is, he is making critical observations about the platform, rather than either celebrating or demonizing it, as so many other accounts seem to. What kind of “observations” are these exactly?\nNotice how they are in many ways a kind of dialog with other sources (which are linked to), from the NYT feature to other articles from the blogosphere. “Theorizing” here, then, doesn’t just involve making abstract “philosophical” pronouncements outside any specific context. Actual philosophers do do this, of course, as we’ll see next week in the case of Byung-Chul Han’s book; but critical analysis typically involves drawing on and applying ideas and often analytical concepts developed by other authoritative sources to the particular context that you are studying. In this sense, critical analysis is always a collaborative endeavor; if you just make unsupported pronouncements, you are unlikely to convince anyone of anything.\nHorning’s range of references is quite broad, including not only contemporary concepts (on which more in a minute) but also applying older historical models to the contemporary context of TikTok. In this case, the reference point is the 1960s French Marxist theorist Guy Debord, whose 1968 work Society of the Spectacle is the source of one of the key concepts in media theory: what Debord calls the Spectacle. Debord was one of the founders of an avant-garde movement called the Situationist International, whose work was vehemently opposed to capitalism and the commodity culture that by the 1960s was sustaining it. Careful to avoid the co-opting and commercialization of previous avant-garde movements like Surrealism, the Situationists did not produce “art” as such and mounted a kind of full-on attack on capitalism itself, developing alternative practices outside its rigid structuring of everyday life into work and leisure time. If you are interested to know more, try searching terms like dérive or détournement for examples of their practices. (The best book on the Situationist International is Greil Marcus’s Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, which discusses its impact on the emergence of punk in the 1970s).\nDebord’s book became the Bible of the SI and its most influential text. The concept of Spectacle continues to be invoked regularly by media theorists such as Horning, in relation to digital culture and social media specifically. The key question here is how valid a theoretical model developed against consumer culture in the 1960s is to today. There have been numerous efforts to update Debord for the present, notably McKenzie Wark’s concept of the “disintegrated spectacle,” which argues that the spectacle as Debord described it (what we could call the Times Square model of media spectacle) has been atomized (or as Wark puts it, disintegrated) into mobile technologies: the Spectacle is no longer–or no longer only–giant electronic billboards but is on the screen of every cellphone.\nSo Horning is drawing on what can be called an “old-school Marxist” model of media critique in conjuring up Debord–along with its familiar vocabulary of alienation and, particularly, reification. The latter is a particularly complex concept that basically means turning something–a lived social practice, for example–into an object; to reify something is to turn it into an object or thing, which in capitalism involves commodity exchange. From this standpoint, in something like TikTok, the commodity is basically you: people engage in a kind of self-reification, turning themselves into commodities, which fuels the attention economy which is the lifeblood of the platform itself.\nOther than Spectacle, the other key theme running through Horning’s article is the notion of passivity. This too, comes out of the 20C Marxist critiques of media. Horning even quotes Debord on this: “[The spectacle] is the sun that never sets on the empire of modern passivity. It covers the entire globe, basking in the perpetual warmth of its own glory.”\nThe idea of communication as an essentially “passive” absorption of media messages was still widespread in the 1960s, but began to be questioned by the field of cultural studies from the 1980s onwards, with the idea of the active audience (work by Ien Ang, John Fiske, and Stuart Hall in particular). With the arrival of videogames, personal computers, the internet, and the web in the subsequent decade, the focus shifted to a paradigm of interactivity, a different kind of active agency in people’s engagement with communication technologies. Although the older media effects model of passivity (the audience as essentially a blank slate that is manipulated by media messages) has continued regardless, including in contemporary critiques of social media, in fields like media and cultural studies–rather than say psychology–it is regarded as discredited.\nA more recent and intriguing concept that has emerged over the past decade, however, and which is referenced by Horning, is the notion of interpassivity (as opposed to the more familiar interactivity). The main source on this is Robert Pfaller’s book on the subject from 2017, whose introduction I’ve provided as a PDF on Blackboard. Interpassivity essentially refers to the idea of experiencing pleasure vicariously, via a third party–whether human or non-human. It can be suggested–and I am sure Rob Horning would agree with this–that it has become one of the fundamental principles of today’s attention economy, from reaction videos to influencer travel vlogs and, yes, recipe videos. The point is always that someone–or something–does it for you, on your behalf as it were. The interpassive agent doesn’t have to be human at all–for example, since the 1980s a VCR “watches” TV shows for you and saves them; algorithms decide for you what to watch, based on your past preferences; a reading app like Blinkist, which provides summaries of bestselling books, reads books for you and provides 15-minute summaries; and so on. There are many other examples; read the intro to Pfaller’s book and you’ll quickly understand how useful the concept of interpassivity can be.\nOther than spectacle and interpassivity, a third concept that we could explore here is simply entertainment in contemporary social media or digital culture. Horning suggests that on TT, what he calls “attention-getting” in itself has evolved into a new form of entertainment in its own right. I wonder what you think of this idea. A similar point is made at the end of the article about AI chatbots and their simulation of “artificial intelligence” rather than actual intelligence in any meaningful–that is to say human–sense. This takes us back to the famous idea of the Turing Test (ask me about this or look it up) for artificial intelligence: the idea that any computer that could pass as human must therefore be considered to be “intelligent”. The test was debunked decades ago–being able to fool someone into thinking the chatbot is a “real person” doesn’t in any way mean that it is “intelligent”–but continues to be influential today. What Horning is suggesting is that the Turing Test has become a contemporary form of chatbot-based entertainment, rather than of any practical utility (which would require it to be actually intelligent). At this point, as Gary Marcus and Ernie Jones describe in their excellent book Rebooting AI, even the most state-of-the-art system isn’t capable of reading and understanding even a children’s story, in terms of the inferences that it contains rather than what is explicitly stated (and can therefore be pattern-matched). So for the moment, we are left with what Max Read describes as a magic trick:\n\na few years in to the generative-A.I. craze, it seems pretty clear to me that these apps, in their current instantiation, are best thought of, like magic tricks, as a form of entertainment. They produce entertainments, yes–images, audio, video, text, shitposts–-but they also are entertainments themselves. Interactions with chatbots like GPT-4o may be incidentally informative or productive, but they are chiefly meant to be entertaining, hence the focus on spookily impressive but useless frippery like emotional affect.\n\nAs Horning concludes:\n\nJust as the point of TikTok’s algorithmic feed is to get people to consume more TikTok, so the point of a chatbot’s conversational interface will be to get people to keep talking to it. Who wouldn’t want to have a chat with a talking advertisement? It is like an algorithmic feed that can put into words how everything is centered on you.\n\nThe ultimate purpose of the magic trick, he is suggesting, is to keep us watching, playing, chatting–because as long as we do that we are paying attention, and our attention is what advertisers are willing to pay a lot of money to SM platforms for. So ultimately, his argument comes down to a political-economic critique, a catalog of the “magic tricks” by which we are induced to keep engaging with the platform (including now, the chatbot platform). So we are left with Neil Postman’s old critique of mass media: are we simply “amusing ourselves to death?”\nI think we are not at all obliged to buy into these arguments, but to consider and scrutinize them carefully. This is the essence of a critical-thinking approach. I think it can in many ways be argued that they are reductive, particularly in the context of the proliferating practices of a platform such as TT (as well documented in the NYT feature). In any event, I hope this gives you some things to think about in relation to social media, “theory”, and the contemporary cultural fascination with AI chatbots."

    "text": "W4: Females: Gender Identity and Social Media\n\n\n\nGirl’s gotta eat.\n—Alex Quicho, “Everyone is a Girl Online”\n\nWhat are the available modalities of female identity circulating on social media in 2024?\n\n\nAlex Quicho, “Everyone is a Girl Online” (WIRED, 11 September 2023)   Emma Copley Eisenberg, “Notes on Frump: A Style for the Rest of Us” (heyalma, 10 August 2017)\nThis is a question that I wanted to explore this week. It’s a question about gender, but a question more specifically about constructions of female identity on contemporary social media platforms. As Alex Quicho’s reference to Andrea Long Chu’s book Females (2018) makes clear, even the idea of what “female” itself means has become disarticulated from its biological (that is anatomical) and social (gender) moorings.\nSo what are some dominant modalities of femaleness and/or femininity in online social environments today? In part they are cultural stereotypes we are already familiar with. Here’s the beginning of a word cloud that you can contribute your own entries to:\nangel complex • bimbos • influencers • Karens • Barbie • beautiful princess disorder (BPD) • SAWs • soccer moms • mom jeans • mukbang (Korean food bloggers) • Japanese VTubers • I’m literally just a girl • wanghong (Chinese influencers) • Xiaoyongshu girls •\nThe two articles that I assigned for us to discuss this week offer more systematic and arguably contradictory answers to our opening question: on the one hand, the cult of the Young-Girl (Tiqqun’s concept, referenced and updated by Alex Quicho); on the other, the Sexy Adult Woman (SAW) modality that is challenged by what Emma Copley Eisenberg calls Frump. Here’s a good example (right margin) of the kind of value that’s attached to the word in mainstream culture, and from which Eisenberg wants to rescue it.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, if you’re looking for summer reading recommendations for after the course is over, Emma Eisenberg has just published a novel, Housemates, that’s supposed to be very good.\n\n\n\nI’m of course very curious to hear your own responses to these two articles, for the moment will limit myself to just a couple of observations that may help to get our discussion going. I’ve also included a Resources section at the end of today’s lecture, which has links to multiple topics either referenced in the main readings or are related to them. If you are interested in focusing on gender in social media for your research project, these links may help you to narrow down and focus on something specific within the very large field of gender online.\n\n\nGirl Swarms\nPerhaps the most conceptually intriguing point to come out of Alex Quicho’s article is that of the girl as a form of collective identity or networked subjectivity. In particular, the frequent references to girl swarms of course takes us back to Byung-Hul Han’s chapters from his book In the Swarm that we were discussing a few weeks back. I’m thinking in particular of passages like this one, which references a few TikTok accounts:\n\nRecently, some popular accounts (@chloe21e8, @lilclearpill, and @heartlocketxo are personal favorites, though it’s more useful to read these as nodes in a swarm rather than the products of any one mind) have struck a collective nerve with their embodiment of an ever-shifting mass voice that is ecstatic, girl-coded, and unknowable. “I’m so mentally stable it’s insane. I have BPD, beautiful princess disorder. I’m so clear-pilled, I can see through the matrix. I’m not left-wing or right-wing, I have angel wings that grow whenever I transcend into space,” goes the swarm thinking that has transcended format, individual creator, and platform to become viral TikTok audios, million-view Reels, Grimes citations, and beautiful-princess Bible verses carved into my brainstem like lovers’ initials in a tree trunk.\n\nThere are some key differences between Han’s and Quicho’s framing of the swarm here. First, for Han, the swarm is an entirely negative consequence of networked communication, producing the kind of scapegoating and shaming culture discussed in the book The Shame Machine. By contrast, Quicho is pretty upbeat about the emancipatory possibilties of the girl swarm and presents the idea of the girl as a kind of “hive mind” in which individual identity is eclipsed by a wider network subjectivity. If you have any immersion in platforms like Instagram and TikTok you will have an idea of what she means.\nCrucially, for Han social media is a world of disconnected, atomized individuals, in contrast to the anonymous effacement of individuals in the modern crowd. For Quicho, social media is the opposite. Or at least, to paraphrase Joe Jackson, It’s Different for Girls…\n\n\nPost-Platform\nYou may have noticed a few references to the term post-platform in Alex Quicho’s article, and may have been wondering about that. This Substack article by Kyle Chayka will help with that, but the main thing to be aware of is that the term itself is now widely regarded as discredited by the emerging new social mediascape. To get a better sense of this, take a look at Sarah Marshall’s recent prediction of how “We get past ‘post-platform’,” which provides an interesting snapshot of the rapid transformations underway in today’s social mediascape. Looking through her list, it’s hard to disagree that Chayka’s melancholy diagnosis of the demise of legacy SM platforms is premature, along with the term “post-platform” itself. Something new is undoubtedly emerging, as we’ll be discussing in the remaining weeks of the course, but even though the future looks more decentralized, social media platforms are clearly not going the way of the dinosaurs anytime soon.\n\n\nResources\nfrumpenberg (ECE’s Instagram)\nFrump Feelings (ECE’s Substack blog)\nBabygirls\n“So babygirl!

It can also be defined more broadly, however, as a set of networked, technologically-mediated practices of communication, structured by economic and political forces that both inflect and are inflected by social and cultural identities. These platforms, the social practices that they enable, and the relationship between the two are the objects of social media theory. But what does it mean to theorize social media? Why do we need social media theory at all?\nTo theorize something involves a number of processes:\n\nfirst, how do we define the phenomenon or object of study itself? How does it differ from previous or other related phenomena?\nhow are we to account for it? Why did it happen/is it happening now rather than at some other time? What are its conditions of possibility?\nwhat is its relation to larger areas of society? What are its implications for those areas?\nhow are we to evaluate it, in terms of its implications (political, economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental, aesthetic)? What are its possibilities and limits, its progressive and oppressive aspects? How can we change it for the better?\n\nThese processes involve developing analytical frameworks or models comprising concepts that are useful for identifying and analyzing key aspects of and issues raised by the phenomenon/object in question. These frameworks and concepts typically draw from existing ones in different fields of study, but often involve the proposal of new frameworks and concepts specific to the field in question.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nanalyze technologies past, present, and imagined\ndescribe the ways in which technologies shape our world the ways in which we shape those technologies\nexplain how social media is a result of the intersection between technologies and existing human communication dynamics\ndiscuss how theory of technology and social media can improve the vocational outlook of a student\nplay a productive role in and facilitate conversations that tease out the relationships between values and technology.\n\nthrough the skills you will refine in writing your research papers, clearly explain how a specific technology shapes the social world that we live in.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese sources are either available online or excerpts will be posted on Blackboard.\nByung-Chul Han, In The Swarm: Digital Prospects (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2017).\nRobert Pfaller, Interpassivity: The Aesthetics of Delegated Enjoyment (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2017).\nWhitney Phillips and Ryan M.

If you have a serious problem that makes punctual submission impossible, you must discuss this matter with me before the due date so that we can make alternative arrangements. Because you are given plenty of time to complete your work, and major due dates are given to you well in advance, last minute problems should not preclude handing in assignments on time.\n\n\n\nFitchburg State University is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and harassment. Please be aware all FSU faculty members are “mandatory reporters,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I am legally required to share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, FSU has staff members trained to support you. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please visit http://fitchburgstate.edu/titleix to access information about university support and resources.\n\n\n\nHealth Services\nHours: Monday-Friday 8:30AM-5PM Location: Ground Level of Russell Towers (across from the entrance of Holmes Dining Hall) Phone: (978) 665-3643/3894\nCounseling Services\nThe Counseling Services Office offers a range of services including individual, couples and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychoeducational programming, outreach ALTERNATIVE ECOSYSTEMSs, and community referrals. Counseling services are confidential and are offered at no charge to all enrolled students. Staff at Counseling Services are also available for consultation to faculty, staff and students. Counseling Services is located in the Hammond, 3rd Floor, Room 317.\nFitchburg Anti-Violence Education (FAVE)\nFAVE collaborates with a number of community partners (e.g., YWCA Domestic Violence Services, Pathways for Change) to meet our training needs and to link survivors with community based resources. This site also features resources for help or information about dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship or has been a victim of sexual assault, there are many places to go for help. Many can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. On campus, free and confidential support is provided at both Counseling Services and Health Services.\nCommunity Food Pantry Food insecurity is a growing issue and it certainly can affect student learning. The ability to have access to nutritious food is incredibly vital. The Falcon Bazaar, located in Hammond G 15, is stocked with food, basic necessities, and can provide meal swipes to support all Fitchburg State students experiencing food insecurity for a day or a semester.\nThe university continues to partner with Our Father’s House to support student needs and access to food and services. All Fitchburg State University students are welcome at the Our Father’s House Community Food Pantry. This Pantry is located at the Faith Christian Church at 40 Boutelle St., Fitchburg, MA and is open from 5-7pm. Each “household” may shop for nutritious food once per month by presenting a valid FSU ID.\n\n\n\nThe University “Academic Integrity” policy can be found online at http:// www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conductmediation-education/academic-integrity/. Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.\nPlagiarism includes, but is not limited to: - Using papers or work from another class. - Using another student’s paper or work from any class. - Copying work or a paper from the Internet. - The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.\nIf you’re not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I’m a strong supporter of Fair Use doctrine. Just attribute what you use–and, again, ASK if there’s any doubt.\n\n\n\nIf you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nAt some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:\n\nPlan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.\nSave work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.\nMake regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.\nSave drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.\nPractice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.\n\n\n\n\nGrading for the course will follow the FSU grading policy below:\n4.0: 95-100\n3.7: 92-94\n3.5: 89-91\n3.3: 86-88\n3.0: 83-85\n2.7: 80-82\n2.5: 77-79\n2.3: 74-76\n2.0: 71-73\n0.0: &lt; 70\n\n\n\nWriting Center\nAcademic Policies\nDisability Services\nFitchburg State Alert system for emergencies, snow closures/delays, and faculty absences\nUniversity Career Services"

    "text": "The term social media is popularly understood as referring to corporate-owned, advertising-funded communication platforms based on user-generated content: YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Discord, TikTok. It can also be defined more broadly, however, as a set of networked, technologically-mediated practices of communication, structured by economic and political forces that both inflect and are inflected by social and cultural identities. These platforms, the social practices that they enable, and the relationship between the two are the objects of social media theory. But what does it mean to theorize social media? Why do we need social media theory at all?\nTo theorize something involves a number of processes:\n\nfirst, how do we define the phenomenon or object of study itself? How does it differ from previous or other related phenomena?\nhow are we to account for it? Why did it happen/is it happening now rather than at some other time? What are its conditions of possibility?\nwhat is its relation to larger areas of society? What are its implications for those areas?\nhow are we to evaluate it, in terms of its implications (political, economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental, aesthetic)? What are its possibilities and limits, its progressive and oppressive aspects? How can we change it for the better?\n\nThese processes involve developing analytical frameworks or models comprising concepts that are useful for identifying and analyzing key aspects of and issues raised by the phenomenon/object in question. These frameworks and concepts typically draw from existing ones in different fields of study, but often involve the proposal of new frameworks and concepts specific to the field in question."

You can think of it like a large, interconnected network of Twitters, albeit without ads or data-collecting. Mastodon (like Pleroma) is basically software that enables anyone to set up their own social media server and host a community on it - you can even do it yourself. \nEach Mastodon community (more commonly known as an instance) has its own particular flavor, and there are communities in many languages. Each community also has its terms of service, that you should read carefully and observe.\nMastodon instances vary in size from just a handful of members to thousands. Many allow you to register a new account without approval, but for a lot you have to submit a registration request and may not be approved because some instances limit numbers to people who are referred by existing members. This is because communities typically have a very specific focus, whatever that may be. My own community, for example, is comprised mainly of coders, game designers, and digital artists. You can still read posts, though - if you’re interested, here’s my account page.\nInstances are connected with one another, so that you only need to set up an account on one. If you follow someone on a different instance, that person’s posts on that instance will appear in your feed on your instance - the federated model again.\nOf course, if people on one instance don’t like the community on another, for whatever reason, they can simply disconnect from it. So the affordances of instances, and the relations between them, are quite resilient against the usual abuses of social media like trolling, spamming, etc.\nChoosing an instance to register with may seem tricky at the beginning because there are so many! Take your time, and keep in mind that you can always switch instances later if you find another one that you like better - or just have multiple accounts on several instances (I have 5-6).\nAfter you join a community, just hang out there and see what goes on. Be sure to follow the account @feditips@mstdn.social, which has lots of useful tips about using Mastodon and other distributed services."

If you’re interested, this YouTube documentary (see right) is a good introduction to Han and his work.\n\n\n\nAs you’ll see, or have seen, Han writes exactly like a philosopher (he’s very influenced by classical German philosophers like Kant and Hegel) - his writing is abstract, with no concrete examples. One of the things I’d like to try to do with you this week, then, is to try to apply some of his concepts and arguments to specific contexts and examples.\nOne among many that came to mind while re-reading his chapters again was the scandal from a few years back about the phenomenon you may have heard of at least vaguely, of “Karens.” In my experience, although referring to certain types of white women with a sense of entitlement as “Karens” has become a meme, many people still know little about the context in which the term originated.\nLuckily for us, this origin is explained in a chapter from Cathy O’Neil’s excellent recent book The Shame Machine, so I decided to include it as optional recommended reading for this week. It’s a narrative rather than theory so is a quick read, but if you have chance to take a look at it I think you’ll see some connections with some of the points that Han is making in his critique of the decline of respect in online social interactions and digital swarms. I’ll be interested to hear how you make that connection in your review assignment due later this week.\nWhile Han’s book is a theoretical text that doesn’t allude to examples, one thing that you should notice about the book is that it does include references to a wide range of other authors and their works: historical writers like Gustave Le Bon; influential Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan; and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, authors of another widely-discussed critique of globalization, Empire.\nAs you see, Han’s writing is in many ways a kind of dialog with these writers, drawing on some of their concepts and building them into his own conceptual/analytical framework. This is an example of good practice in writing theory—contrary to how it may appear, theoretical thinking and writing never take place in a conceptual vacuum but always in dialog with other thinkers, whether you agree or disagree with them. So try to use Han’s book as a model for your own approach to writing about social media theory.\nWhat of the concepts and arguments themselves? Leaving aside the use of the term shitstorms in a philosophy book (!), I think Han’s writing is extremely lucid and makes some useful conceptual distinctions—betweeen anger and rage, for example, or the historical distinction between crowds in the modern, embodied sense, and what Han calls digital swarms, an altogether different kind of animal that as users of social media we are all too familiar with! I wonder what you made of this distinction in particular, especially the idea that crowds have a collective dimension (in which people’s individuality is subordinated to the mass), whereas swarms are composed of disconnected individuals, or what he calls anonymous somebodys (I love this term :)\nOne thing that’s super clear is that Han prefers crowds to swarms (he clearly doesn’t share Le Bon’s distaste for crowds). Crowds have a soul or spirit, terms that immediately have a positive connotation; they have a collective, community dimension. They have a purpose, symbolically signified by the archetypal activity of the crowd: the march; as Han points out, digital swarms do not march! They simply consist of outraged anonymous individuals, and their anger is largely without consequence, quickly dissipating or fastening onto another target. I was wondering how well you thought this analysis applies to online shitstorms or other scandals that you are aware of; can you think of other related examples?\nMore generally, how accurate do you find Han’s melancholy diagnosis of social media communication? He’s certainly not alone in making this kind of critique–the notion of toxicity and polluted environments is more pervasive in recent critique such as Ryan Milner and Whitney Phillips’s book You Are Here).\nBut of course, we don’t have to agree! For example, one aspect of this kind of theoretical writing is that it tends to be overly schematic, in the sense of reducing the complexities of social and cultural practices to overly rigid, black-and-white distinctions. The highly ideological crowds vs. swarms distinction is a case in point, or the “de-individualized nobodies” vs. “individual anonymous somebodies” distinction later on. It doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. So we might try to scrutinize and pull apart these distinctions: for example, how valid is this crowds vs. swarms opposition? Could it not be argued that Han’s account of crowds is invoking a nostalgic kind of folk politics, as Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams call it in their recent critique of left politics, Inventing the Future?\nFor example, the Turkish journalist Zeynep Tufecki has an excellent book called Twitter and Tear Gas which is an account of the use of Facebook and Twitter by oppositional political movements in Tunisia and Egypt that led to the overthrow of autocratic regimes in those countries known as the Arab Spring. Tufecki herself is critical of dismissals of the capacity of social media platforms as catalysts for progressive social change, made by writers like Evgeny Morozov in his aptly-titled book The Net Delusion. Han seems to think that basically nothing good can come out of online communication, but do you think that’s really true? Don’t be afraid to think against the grain and try to come up with counter-examples or arguments.\nOne last point about the decline of civility as the basis for the public sphere—an influential concept elaborated by another German philosopher, Jürgen Habermas (1962; Eng. trans. 1989). Of course by now we are all familiar with 4chan and the phenomenon of trolling–if you’re not, Whitney Phillips’s book This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things will walk you through that ugly side of online communication.\nBut again, is it correct simply to assume that “we” (whoever this term refers to) are indeed no longer civil with one another on SM platforms? Surely it depends on where you look, rather than making blanket generalizations? As far as I can see, many interactions on social media are highly respectful and civil, and many online communities go to often difficult lengths to try to ensure this.\nTo get an idea of this, look at the “Code of Conduct” statements on many communities. Here’s an example from the p5.js creative coding community.\nOr how about the Three Gates of Speech, which is recommended on the Mastodon community that I’m a member of. If you haven’t come across this, it’s a very interesting read, but also problematizes simple narratives about social media being some kind of lawless frontier dominated by trolls and outlaws.\nEntire SM platforms are dedicated to trying to reproduce the model of the public sphere, as an arena of civil discourse and debate in which people are respectful of and try to listen seriously to perspectivs other than their own. They are explicitly meant to counter the all-too-familiar critique of the silo-ing of SM communities into echo chambers of confirmation bias. As an example, take a look at the conversations going on on the platform Kialo, founded in 2018. For more information about it, see this article."

    "text": "W4: Fangirls\nI hope you enjoyed Nancy Baym’s account of how social media have transformed the relationship of musicians to their audiences, and to their fans in particular.\nI wanted to start with a few questions, and then make some observations about what appear to be some of the blind spots in Baym’s account, perhaps because of the warp speed at which social media platforms themselves are constantly evolving.\nSome questions first. Since we’re all, in varying degrees, music fans, I’m wondering how any of the relationships between musicians and fans that Baym describes connect to your own experience. Do you follow closely the social media accounts of artists and/or bands that you’re a fan of? Have you yourself had any direct personal interactions on social media platforms with musicians that you’re a fan of? Have you encountered musicians after concerts that you’ve attended, at the merchandise table or elsewhere? If so, did your experience correspond with Baym’s account, in terms of the ritualistic nature of the interaction or the specific boundaries in live venues?\nWith regard to blind spots, the most obvious elephant in the room is TikTok, although to be fair the book was researched and written several years before the platform arrived. So my question here is quite specific: how far do you think the “relational affordances,” in terms of the new ways for musicians and fans to interact with one another on SM platforms, that Baym describes in the case of MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, have carried over to TikTok? Or have the platform’s own particular affordances further transformed the relationship between musicians and their audiences? If so, how? What are the particular challenges that an SM platform like TikTok poses to musicians seeking to “sneak into the everyday lives” of their audiences, and how differently are they going about doing so?\nOne other blind spot of Baym’s discussion that struck me was the absence from it of any consideration of a new musical generation that has emerged in recent years: the social media musician. As you’ll have seen, Baym’s book is exclusively concerned with musicians whose careers developed in generations that pre-date social media platforms, and who can thus be considered as “late adopters” (as opposed to “early adopters”), in that they and their managements have had to adapt as best they can to the new rules of the game. This older generation includes musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Bill Bragg, REM, Roger O’Donnell of The Cure, and others.\nHowever, as I’m sure many of you will also know, the past decade in particular has seen the emergence of many new musicians whose careers originate on social media platforms, particularly YouTube. Just a few examples:\n\nAndrew Hwang\nMylar Melodies\nEmily Hopkins\nJosie Charlwood\nHainbach\n\nMusicians like these differ from the generation that Baym discusses in that they belong to a younger generation (millennials, Gen-Z) and can be considered “social media natives” (to adapt the “digital natives” concept). Although they do perform live, YouTube is their primary distribution platform, in tandem with Soundcloud and Bandcamp (for direct sales to their fans). They are highly adept at managing their online musical persona, including via Instagram, Facebook, and/or Twitter.\nWhile Baym’s account of how “traditional” rock and other musicians are adapting to the new rules of the game of social media, it could be argued that we should be paying closer attention to how the current generation of social media musicians have been developing new kinds of musical personas, as well as new and more direct ways of building and maintaining their social media fanbase.\nSo I’m wondering what other, similar examples you can think of that exemplify this new category of the social media musician? Do you follow any such musicians yourself? If so, feel free to add links to them in the Discord discussion.\nTo tie the two strands of the preceding discussion together, is there now an emerging generation of TikTok musicians? Although I’m more familiar with YouTube musicians, this is pretty much unknown territory to me, so I’d be interested in any examples that come to mind either of how established musicians are using TikTok, or upcoming ones are using it as a platform for their music. This would be a good complement to Baym’s account of how today’s SM platforms are transforming the relationship between a previous generation of musicians and their fanbases.\nLastly, if you’re interested in the contemporary convergence between the music business and social media, check out music journalist Cherie Hu’s website, which also hosts her newsletter, Water & Music.
