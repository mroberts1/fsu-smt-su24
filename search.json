    "section": "",
    "text": "In flattening the diversity of facial expressions of civilizations around the world AI had collapsed the spectrum of history, culture, photography, and emotion concepts into a singular, monolithic perspective. It presented a false visual narrative about the universality of something that in the real world—where real humans have lived and created culture, expression, and meaning for hundreds of thousands of years—is anything but uniform.\n\n\n\nJenka Gurfinkel, “AI and the American Smile” (Medium, 17 March 2023)   Michael Standaert, “Smile for the Camera: The Dark Side of China’s Emotion-Recognition Tech” (The Guardian, 3 March 2021)\n\n—Jenka Gurfinkel, “AI and the American Smile”\n\nSo this week we are tackling everybody’s favorite social-media topic: the selfie, or if you’ve read the reading assignment, might be more accurately called the smilie.\nI initially assigned only Jenka Gurfinkel’s article for this week, because the article itself is packed with references to other sources that you are presumably also going to want to explore. But as I was rereading it, I decided to add one other recent article that came to mind, that adds a different perspective to the discussion of social media, cameras, and smiling: a Guardian article about the use of facial recognition as a tool of social control in contemporary China. So in some ways, this week we could think about not just the smile but the face in social media, as a focus of social, cultural, and political power.\nConceptually, the trickiest concept that’s referenced in the AI-selfie article is “uncertainty avoidance,” a rather self-contradictory notion that may need clarification. My favorite example of this is from country walking. As I’m sure you know, it’s an unspoken convention when out walking in a forest or some other remote location, that if you pass someone walking in the other direction, you are expected to make eye contact, say “Hi!,” and above all, smile at the other person(s)! Why do we all do this? We don’t do it when walking around town, for example. The answer is: to avoid uncertainty - uncertainty, that is, about the potentially malevolent intentions of the other we are encountering in this remote place. In short, eye contact, a brief verbal greeting, and, especially, a smile are a way of reassuring the other person that you are not a psycho.\nOf course, given that as the article also explains (in the reference to the University of Rochester study), smiling is also a sign of duplicity, there is no reason to be reassured by the smiling stranger that we may encounter alone in a forest; in such cases, indeed, the smile may actually be more a source of anxiety than reassurance.\nRegardless of whether smiles and a cheerful demeanor are reassuring or not, the central point of the article is that smiling is a cultural practice: even though everyone smiles (universal humanism), we do so - or not - for very different reasons (cultural specificity). The Russian examples discussed in the article are perhaps the clearest example of this.\nThe central question raised by Gurfinkel’s argument, however, stems from its title: how far can smiling—at least self-type smiling—be considered specifically “American”? Did Americans invent this kind of smiling?\nIn answer to this, I would add one other example to the discussion of the cultural dimension of smiling: what I would call the subaltern smile. (“Subaltern” here refers to a form of social subjectivity that has internalized structures of domination and accept, even welcome, their position of subservience). From this standpoint, the smile is a sign of subservience, of eagerness to be of service - is there anything else I can do for you? As the example of the Russian bank teller in the US shows, such smiling is often not just a social but a professional requirement, a form of coercion. In his book Black Skin, White Masks, the postcolonial theorist Franz Fanon writes about how during imperialism Africans were expected to smile for their colonial masters, as a sign of their willing acceptance of their subservient role. There are numerous examples of this, but the most famous one is the ubiquitous image of the WW1/WW2 African infantryman in the French army (the tirailleur sénégalais) that was used for the chocolate milk brand Banania.\n\n\n     \nWe see from this example that Gurfinkel’s point that smiling is a sign of confidence or power does not always apply, that smiling has many other cultural meanings.\nWhat if AIs were trained not on models of American smiles but African ones? In light of the history of slavery, how awkward does this make the AI selfie of “Ancient African Tribal Warriors”?\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfie Studies\nThe discussion of “smiling for the camera” is itself part of the larger study of the selfe in social media, a field that is much more developed than you would ever believe. To get an idea of the scope of this field, you could start with the Selfies Research Network, founded (as far as I know) by Theresa Senft and other colleagues, notably Alice Marwick. In light of this week’s reading, you may be struck by Alice’s authentically American smile!\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring selfie culture for your research paper, there are many directions you could go, including music video:\n\nI’ll be interested to see what other examples are brought to mind both by this week’s readings and my lecture!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "My Night at Maud’s (Eric Rohmer, 1969)\n\n\nByung-Chul Han is a Korean-German philosopher who is best known for his short but influential book The Burnout Society (2015, originally published in German as Müdigkeitsgesellschaft, 2010). If you’re interested, this YouTube documentary (see right) is a good introduction to Han and his work.\n\n\n\nAs you’ll see, or have seen, Han writes exactly like a philosopher (he’s very influenced by classical German philosophers like Kant and Hegel) - his writing is abstract, with no concrete examples. One of the things I’d like to try to do with you this week, then, is to try to apply some of his concepts and arguments to specific contexts and examples.\nOne among many that came to mind while re-reading his chapters again was the scandal from a few years back about the phenomenon you may have heard of at least vaguely, of “Karens.” In my experience, although referring to certain types of white women with a sense of entitlement as “Karens” has become a meme, many people still know little about the context in which the term originated.\nLuckily for us, this origin is explained in a chapter from Cathy O’Neil’s excellent recent book The Shame Machine, so I decided to include it as optional recommended reading for this week. It’s a narrative rather than theory so is a quick read, but if you have chance to take a look at it I think you’ll see some connections with some of the points that Han is making in his critique of the decline of respect in online social interactions and digital swarms. I’ll be interested to hear how you make that connection in your review assignment due later this week.\nWhile Han’s book is a theoretical text that doesn’t allude to examples, one thing that you should notice about the book is that it does include references to a wide range of other authors and their works: historical writers like Gustave Le Bon; influential Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan; and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, authors of another widely-discussed critique of globalization, Empire.\nAs you see, Han’s writing is in many ways a kind of dialog with these writers, drawing on some of their concepts and building them into his own conceptual/analytical framework. This is an example of good practice in writing theory—contrary to how it may appear, theoretical thinking and writing never take place in a conceptual vacuum but always in dialog with other thinkers, whether you agree or disagree with them. So try to use Han’s book as a model for your own approach to writing about social media theory.\nWhat of the concepts and arguments themselves? Leaving aside the use of the term shitstorms in a philosophy book (!), I think Han’s writing is extremely lucid and makes some useful conceptual distinctions—betweeen anger and rage, for example, or the historical distinction between crowds in the modern, embodied sense, and what Han calls digital swarms, an altogether different kind of animal that as users of social media we are all too familiar with! I wonder what you made of this distinction in particular, especially the idea that crowds have a collective dimension (in which people’s individuality is subordinated to the mass), whereas swarms are composed of disconnected individuals, or what he calls anonymous somebodys (I love this term :)\nOne thing that’s super clear is that Han prefers crowds to swarms (he clearly doesn’t share Le Bon’s distaste for crowds). Crowds have a soul or spirit, terms that immediately have a positive connotation; they have a collective, community dimension. They have a purpose, symbolically signified by the archetypal activity of the crowd: the march; as Han points out, digital swarms do not march! They simply consist of outraged anonymous individuals, and their anger is largely without consequence, quickly dissipating or fastening onto another target. I was wondering how well you thought this analysis applies to online shitstorms or other scandals that you are aware of; can you think of other related examples?\nMore generally, how accurate do you find Han’s melancholy diagnosis of social media communication? He’s certainly not alone in making this kind of critique–the notion of toxicity and polluted environments is more pervasive in recent critique such as Ryan Milner and Whitney Phillips’s book You Are Here).\nBut of course, we don’t have to agree! For example, one aspect of this kind of theoretical writing is that it tends to be overly schematic, in the sense of reducing the complexities of social and cultural practices to overly rigid, black-and-white distinctions. The highly ideological crowds vs. swarms distinction is a case in point, or the “de-individualized nobodies” vs. “individual anonymous somebodies” distinction later on. It doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. So we might try to scrutinize and pull apart these distinctions: for example, how valid is this crowds vs. swarms opposition? Could it not be argued that Han’s account of crowds is invoking a nostalgic kind of folk politics, as Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams call it in their recent critique of left politics, Inventing the Future?\nFor example, the Turkish journalist Zeynep Tufecki has an excellent book called Twitter and Tear Gas which is an account of the use of Facebook and Twitter by oppositional political movements in Tunisia and Egypt that led to the overthrow of autocratic regimes in those countries known as the Arab Spring. Tufecki herself is critical of dismissals of the capacity of social media platforms as catalysts for progressive social change, made by writers like Evgeny Morozov in his aptly-titled book The Net Delusion. Han seems to think that basically nothing good can come out of online communication, but do you think that’s really true? Don’t be afraid to think against the grain and try to come up with counter-examples or arguments.\nOne last point about the decline of civility as the basis for the public sphere—an influential concept elaborated by another German philosopher, Jürgen Habermas (1962; Eng. trans. 1989). Of course by now we are all familiar with 4chan and the phenomenon of trolling–if you’re not, Whitney Phillips’s book This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things will walk you through that ugly side of online communication.\nBut again, is it correct simply to assume that “we” (whoever this term refers to) are indeed no longer civil with one another on SM platforms? Surely it depends on where you look, rather than making blanket generalizations? As far as I can see, many interactions on social media are highly respectful and civil, and many online communities go to often difficult lengths to try to ensure this.\nTo get an idea of this, look at the “Code of Conduct” statements on many communities. Here’s an example from the p5.js creative coding community.\nOr how about the Three Gates of Speech, which is recommended on the Mastodon community that I’m a member of. If you haven’t come across this, it’s a very interesting read, but also problematizes simple narratives about social media being some kind of lawless frontier dominated by trolls and outlaws.\nEntire SM platforms are dedicated to trying to reproduce the model of the public sphere, as an arena of civil discourse and debate in which people are respectful of and try to listen seriously to perspectivs other than their own. They are explicitly meant to counter the all-too-familiar critique of the silo-ing of SM communities into echo chambers of confirmation bias. As an example, take a look at the conversations going on on the platform Kialo, founded in 2018. For more information about it, see this article."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe term social media is popularly understood as referring to corporate-owned, advertising-funded communication platforms based on user-generated content: YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Discord, TikTok. It can also be defined more broadly, however, as a set of networked, technologically-mediated practices of communication, structured by economic and political forces that both inflect and are inflected by social and cultural identities. These platforms, the social practices that they enable, and the relationship between the two are the objects of social media theory. But what does it mean to theorize social media? Why do we need social media theory at all?\nTo theorize something involves a number of processes:\n\nfirst, how do we define the phenomenon or object of study itself? How does it differ from previous or other related phenomena?\nhow are we to account for it? Why did it happen/is it happening now rather than at some other time? What are its conditions of possibility?\nwhat is its relation to larger areas of society? What are its implications for those areas?\nhow are we to evaluate it, in terms of its implications (political, economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental, aesthetic)? What are its possibilities and limits, its progressive and oppressive aspects? How can we change it for the better?\n\nThese processes involve developing analytical frameworks or models comprising concepts that are useful for identifying and analyzing key aspects of and issues raised by the phenomenon/object in question. These frameworks and concepts typically draw from existing ones in different fields of study, but often involve the proposal of new frameworks and concepts specific to the field in question."

    "text": "I hope that by now you’ve had chance to look at at least the first of the articles by Rob Horning, and hopefully also some of the sources that he links to - especially the New York Times articles about TikTok (hereafter TT).\nAs you know, he references Becky Hughes’s short piece about TT recipe videos, which is really good. I’ve also posted a page with links from the TT trends article on the syllabus outside Blackboard (see the dropdown menu under Resources).\nSo there are a few things I was thinking about in selecting this reading assignment for us to get started with:\n\nWhat does it mean exactly to “theorize” about “social media”?\nWhat exactly does the term “social media” cover anyway?\nHow do we even begin to “theorize” about a SM platform like TikTok and the many cultures proliferating on it?\n\nRob Horning’s critique at least gives us a place to start, and an example of engaging in critical analysis of (commonly known as “theorizing”) social media. I guess the first thing to note is that it is a critique - that is, he is making critical observations about the platform, rather than either celebrating or demonizing it, as so many other accounts seem to. What kind of “observations” are these exactly?\nNotice how they are in many ways a kind of dialog with other sources (which are linked to), from the NYT feature to other articles from the blogosphere. “Theorizing” here, then, doesn’t just involve making abstract “philosophical” pronouncements outside any specific context. Actual philosophers do do this, of course, as we’ll see next week in the case of Byung-Chul Han’s book; but critical analysis typically involves drawing on and applying ideas and often analytical concepts developed by other authoritative sources to the particular context that you are studying. In this sense, critical analysis is always a collaborative endeavor; if you just make unsupported pronouncements, you are unlikely to convince anyone of anything.\nHorning’s range of references is quite broad, including not only contemporary concepts (on which more in a minute) but also applying older historical models to the contemporary context of TikTok. In this case, the reference point is the 1960s French Marxist theorist Guy Debord, whose 1968 work Society of the Spectacle is the source of one of the key concepts in media theory: what Debord calls the Spectacle. Debord was one of the founders of an avant-garde movement called the Situationist International, whose work was vehemently opposed to capitalism and the commodity culture that by the 1960s was sustaining it. Careful to avoid the co-opting and commercialization of previous avant-garde movements like Surrealism, the Situationists did not produce “art” as such and mounted a kind of full-on attack on capitalism itself, developing alternative practices outside its rigid structuring of everyday life into work and leisure time. If you are interested to know more, try searching terms like dérive or détournement for examples of their practices. (The best book on the Situationist International is Greil Marcus’s Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, which discusses its impact on the emergence of punk in the 1970s).\nDebord’s book became the Bible of the SI and its most influential text. The concept of Spectacle continues to be invoked regularly by media theorists such as Horning, in relation to digital culture and social media specifically. The key question here is how valid a theoretical model developed against consumer culture in the 1960s is to today. There have been numerous efforts to update Debord for the present, notably McKenzie Wark’s concept of the “disintegrated spectacle,” which argues that the spectacle as Debord described it (what we could call the Times Square model of media spectacle) has been atomized (or as Wark puts it, disintegrated) into mobile technologies: the Spectacle is no longer–or no longer only–giant electronic billboards but is on the screen of every cellphone.\nSo Horning is drawing on what can be called an “old-school Marxist” model of media critique in conjuring up Debord–along with its familiar vocabulary of alienation and, particularly, reification. The latter is a particularly complex concept that basically means turning something–a lived social practice, for example–into an object; to reify something is to turn it into an object or thing, which in capitalism involves commodity exchange. From this standpoint, in something like TikTok, the commodity is basically you: people engage in a kind of self-reification, turning themselves into commodities, which fuels the attention economy which is the lifeblood of the platform itself.\nOther than Spectacle, the other key theme running through Horning’s article is the notion of passivity. This too, comes out of the 20C Marxist critiques of media. Horning even quotes Debord on this: “[The spectacle] is the sun that never sets on the empire of modern passivity. It covers the entire globe, basking in the perpetual warmth of its own glory.”\nThe idea of communication as an essentially “passive” absorption of media messages was still widespread in the 1960s, but began to be questioned by the field of cultural studies from the 1980s onwards, with the idea of the active audience (work by Ien Ang, John Fiske, and Stuart Hall in particular). With the arrival of videogames, personal computers, the internet, and the web in the subsequent decade, the focus shifted to a paradigm of interactivity, a different kind of active agency in people’s engagement with communication technologies. Although the older media effects model of passivity (the audience as essentially a blank slate that is manipulated by media messages) has continued regardless, including in contemporary critiques of social media, in fields like media and cultural studies–rather than say psychology–it is regarded as discredited.\nA more recent and intriguing concept that has emerged over the past decade, however, and which is referenced by Horning, is the notion of interpassivity (as opposed to the more familiar interactivity). The main source on this is Robert Pfaller’s book on the subject from 2017, whose introduction I’ve provided as a PDF on Blackboard. Interpassivity essentially refers to the idea of experiencing pleasure vicariously, via a third party–whether human or non-human. It can be suggested–and I am sure Rob Horning would agree with this–that it has become one of the fundamental principles of today’s attention economy, from reaction videos to influencer travel vlogs and, yes, recipe videos. The point is always that someone–or something–does it for you, on your behalf as it were. The interpassive agent doesn’t have to be human at all–for example, since the 1980s a VCR “watches” TV shows for you and saves them; algorithms decide for you what to watch, based on your past preferences; a reading app like Blinkist, which provides summaries of bestselling books, reads books for you and provides 15-minute summaries; and so on. There are many other examples; read the intro to Pfaller’s book and you’ll quickly understand how useful the concept of interpassivity can be.\nOther than spectacle and interpassivity, a third concept that we could explore here is simply entertainment in contemporary social media or digital culture. Horning suggests that on TT, what he calls “attention-getting” in itself has evolved into a new form of entertainment in its own right. I wonder what you think of this idea. A similar point is made at the end of the article about AI chatbots and their simulation of “artificial intelligence” rather than actual intelligence in any meaningful–that is to say human–sense. This takes us back to the famous idea of the Turing Test (ask me about this or look it up) for artificial intelligence: the idea that any computer that could pass as human must therefore be considered to be “intelligent”. The test was debunked decades ago–being able to fool someone into thinking the chatbot is a “real person” doesn’t in any way mean that it is “intelligent”–but continues to be influential today. What Horning is suggesting is that the Turing Test has become a contemporary form of chatbot-based entertainment, rather than of any practical utility (which would require it to be actually intelligent). At this point, as Gary Marcus and Ernie Jones describe in their excellent book Rebooting AI, even the most state-of-the-art system isn’t capable of reading and understanding even a children’s story, in terms of the inferences that it contains rather than what is explicitly stated (and can therefore be pattern-matched). So for the moment, we are left with what Max Read describes as a magic trick:\n\na few years in to the generative-A.I. craze, it seems pretty clear to me that these apps, in their current instantiation, are best thought of, like magic tricks, as a form of entertainment. They produce entertainments, yes–images, audio, video, text, shitposts–-but they also are entertainments themselves. Interactions with chatbots like GPT-4o may be incidentally informative or productive, but they are chiefly meant to be entertaining, hence the focus on spookily impressive but useless frippery like emotional affect.\n\nAs Horning concludes:\n\nJust as the point of TikTok’s algorithmic feed is to get people to consume more TikTok, so the point of a chatbot’s conversational interface will be to get people to keep talking to it. Who wouldn’t want to have a chat with a talking advertisement? It is like an algorithmic feed that can put into words how everything is centered on you.\n\nThe ultimate purpose of the magic trick, he is suggesting, is to keep us watching, playing, chatting–because as long as we do that we are paying attention, and our attention is what advertisers are willing to pay a lot of money to SM platforms for. So ultimately, his argument comes down to a political-economic critique, a catalog of the “magic tricks” by which we are induced to keep engaging with the platform (including now, the chatbot platform). So we are left with Neil Postman’s old critique of mass media: are we simply “amusing ourselves to death?”\nI think we are not at all obliged to buy into these arguments, but to consider and scrutinize them carefully. This is the essence of a critical-thinking approach. I think it can in many ways be argued that they are reductive, particularly in the context of the proliferating practices of a platform such as TT (as well documented in the NYT feature). In any event, I hope this gives you some things to think about in relation to social media, “theory”, and the contemporary cultural fascination with AI chatbots."
